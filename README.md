# Hermite-Interpolation
该程序使用Python编写，使用Hermite插值法计算函数的插值多项式。在实际问题中，为了确保插值函数具有连续光滑性并满足工程实际问题的约束，我们不仅要求插值多项式在插值节点上的函数值相同，还要求插值函数在插值点的导数与原函数在该点的导数值相等。为了满足这种要求，Hermite提出了Hermite插值多项式，该多项式既满足在插值点处与原函数值相等，又满足在插值点处的导数与原函数的导数相等，或满足特定的约束条件。代码中包含详细的注释，以便更好地理解其内容。

This program is written in Python and is used to calculate the interpolation polynomial of a function using the Hermite interpolation method. In practical problems, to ensure that the interpolation function is continuously smooth and satisfies the constraints of real-world engineering problems, we not only require the interpolated polynomial to have the same function values at the interpolation nodes but also demand that the interpolation function's derivatives at the interpolation points match the derivatives of the original function at those points. To meet these requirements, Hermite introduced the Hermite interpolation polynomial, which satisfies both the equality of function values at the interpolation points and the equality of derivatives with the original function at those points, or satisfies specific constraint conditions. The code includes detailed comments to better understand its content.
